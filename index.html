        <h2>Parent Involvement</h2>
        <p>We maintain an "open door" policy. All parents are welcome to be at the school at all times. As a family-run kindergarten, 
            we keenly feel the need to build a community for families, and we do our best to make everyone feel welcome 
            and comfortable here.</p>
            <p>We do several things in order to ensure ongoing communication: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parents are involved in parent-teacher meetings twice a year, or more often if need be</li>
                <li>Information about the child's day is shared at pick-up either personally or through a written daily report</li>
                <li>Although the teachers' focus during the day is on the children and they may not be available to answer the 
                    phone, the school's administrative coordinator is also on hand to answer calls</li>

                and active and feel very much at home.</p>
            <p>Although the classroom does not have any of the traditional toys that you may expect to see in a 
                preschool, you will see energetic children working hard at playing because the materials they are working with
                 allow their imaginations to run free.</p>

                <p>Our Classes ranges from 2.5 â€” 6 years old. In an environment such as this, it naturally happens that older 
                    students help the younger ones, and the younger ones learn from the older. Having mixed ages is like having more
                     teachers in one class.</p>
                     <p>Mixing ages also helps us provide our kids with a natural "extended family" atmosphere.</p>

                    <h2>Celebrate Diversity</h2>
                    <p>As an international preschool, we are able to expose our children to a wealth of different backgrounds, 
                        lifestyles and abilities. This diversity helps us teach them that there are "many right ways to live, many right ways
                         to solve problems and many right ways to look at the world".</p>
                         <p>At Maple Tree Montessori, we want our children to explore, and to teach them that there is more than one solution 
                             to anything. We can show them a variety of lifestyles, making sure that we respect them all. Some of the ways that we 
                             accomplish this are by: learning about family beliefs, sharing personal and cultural traditions, or giving back to the local 
                             residents through community service.</p>
                         <p>We also include both women and men in our staff, and these nurturing women and men provide healthy role models 
                             to the children and families in our community.</p>

    <P>'I could not be happier with Little Pixies! My daughter absolutely loves it and has developed so much 
        since starting. As a fellow practitioner, I recognise the outstanding teaching and learning that happens on a daily basis. 
        The team are passionately dedicated and this shows in the progress of the children's learning and wellbeing. I can't 
        recommend this Kindergarten enough. Thank you for all your hard work ladies!' </p>

        additional health needs. He loves getting close to nature every day and has come on leaps and bounds in his physical and 
        cognitive abilities. We have all made friends and local connections in the village, benefitting our lives dramatically!  
        Little Pixies has been our saviour and I can't thank Kristie enough for her efforts. We highly recommend this setting.' </p>
