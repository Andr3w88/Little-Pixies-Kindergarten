# **_Little Pixies - Kindergarten_**

Don't we all have a dream for ourselves??

A good child care facility needs the kind of people who will act as a unifying force and pull the program together to make it cohesive.

We have a vision of the kind of child care we want to provide and we are filled with the enthusiasm & perseverance to accomplish this.

We are living our dream, and we hope to continue year after year with your support. Let our dream inspire your children!!

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The font chosen is 'Merienda' for the body text. They fall back to cursive and sans-serif respectively. 
      * 'Merienda' is a nice handwriting font for the purpuse of parents kids, being easy to read for all.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen was a mix of 5 colors.  Sandy Brown a shade of  orange,   
    Medium Carmine a shade of red, Cream a shade of white, Steal Teal a shade of blue and Old Burgundy a shade of maro. This is something that Little Pixies can hopefully pass onto the user.
