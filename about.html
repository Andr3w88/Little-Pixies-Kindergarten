                        development of our children's independence and their natural psychological progress, giving them freedom 
                        within a certain structure.</p>

    <h2>Parent Involvement</h2>
    <p>We maintain an "open door" policy. All parents are welcome to be at the school at all times. As a family-run kindergarten, 
        we keenly feel the need to build a community for families, and we do our best to make everyone feel welcome 
        and comfortable here.</p>
        <p>We do several things in order to ensure ongoing communication: </p>
            <p>Parents are involved in parent-teacher meetings twice a year, or more often if need be.</p>
            <p>Information about the child's day is shared at pick-up either personally or through a written daily report.</p>
            <p>Although the teachers' focus during the day is on the children and they may not be available to answer the 
                phone, the school's administrative coordinator is also on hand to answer calls.</p>

        <h2>Children at Play</h2>
        <p>When children feel good they are active, curious and ready to engage themselves in play.</p>
            <p>When you come to visit us, make sure to watch the children already here. They are very happy
                and active and feel very much at home.</p>
            <p>Although the classroom does not have any of the traditional toys that you may expect to see in a 
                preschool, you will see energetic children working hard at playing because the materials they are working with
                 allow their imaginations to run free.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Age Classes</h2>
        <p>Our Classes ranges from 2.5 â€” 6 years old. In an environment such as this, it naturally happens that older 
            students help the younger ones, and the younger ones learn from the older. Having mixed ages is like having more
             teachers in one class.</p>
             <p>Mixing ages also helps us provide our kids with a natural "extended family" atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>Celebrate Diversity</h2>
            <p>As an international preschool, we are able to expose our children to a wealth of different backgrounds, 
                lifestyles and abilities. This diversity helps us teach them that there are "many right ways to live, many right ways
                 to solve problems and many right ways to look at the world".</p>
                 <p>At Maple Tree Montessori, we want our children to explore, and to teach them that there is more than one solution 
                     to anything. We can show them a variety of lifestyles, making sure that we respect them all. Some of the ways that we 
                     accomplish this are by: learning about family beliefs, sharing personal and cultural traditions, or giving back to the local 
                     residents through community service.</p>
                 <p>We also include both women and men in our staff, and these nurturing women and men provide healthy role models 
                     to the children and families in our community.</p>
